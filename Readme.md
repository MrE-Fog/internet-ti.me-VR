# Internet-Ti.me VR

[internet-ti.me](https://internet-ti.me)-powered [Internet Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time) reference on your virtual reality wristwatch, powered by [OVR Toolkit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1068820/OVR_Toolkit/)

## How

This takes advantage of OVR Toolkit's ability to pin a little web page to your wrist, and piggybacks on the wristwatch's position, attempting to align itself with that automatically. It'll then sit there quietly updating the Internet Time in the background.

As a bonus, it runs entirely offline, and uses no resources from third party servers!
